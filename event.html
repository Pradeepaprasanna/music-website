    <!--<p>An events party description, or event description, is a piece of writing that provides potential attendees with
        the essential information they need to decide if they want to attend. It should include the "who, what, when,
        where, and why" of the event, and sometimes "how". A good description also highlights what makes the event
        unique and engaging. Give me one good reason why I should give up my limited spare time to come to your Science
        Week event! While you‚Äôre at it, give me a few good reasons.

        A strong and clear event description excites punters: tell them what will happen at the event, who will be
        speaking, and what they might get out of attending. Your event may be brilliant, but no one else will know
        without you telling and convincing them.

        Good event descriptions can also lead to more media coverage. This is important‚Äîboth for encouraging people to
        attend events and for talking about science with a broader audience. The descriptions of registered events give
        the publicity team material to work with and provide journalists with leads for events and speakers that might
        make good stories.</p>-->

    <marquee>A music event can be described as a gathering centered around music, whether it's a single concert, a
        festival, or a more casual gathering. These events can be themed around musical genres, nationalities, or local
        musicians. They often involve live performances, and may also include food, merchandise, and other activities.

    <p>A gallery photo event description typically involves capturing and sharing photographs from an event, whether
        it's a physical or virtual gathering. These photos can be displayed in a physical gallery, online through a
        virtual lobby, or shared via social media. The goal is to showcase the event's highlights, atmosphere, and
        memories through visual storytelling. </p>
